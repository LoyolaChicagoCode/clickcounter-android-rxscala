# Learning Objectives

This example is intended as a starting point for anyone planning develop
*reactive* Android applications using Scala. Its learning objectives are:

- Android application development using Scala
    - using the Simple Build Tool (sbt) for Scala in conjunction with 
      [pfn's well-maintained plugin](https://github.com/pfn/android-sdk-plugin)
    - using IntelliJ IDEA
- Android application architecture for testability and maintainability
    - [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)
    - [Model-View-Adapter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-adapter) architectural pattern
    - Separation of Android activity into event-handling and lifecycle management
    - Separation of stateful and reactive components using [RxScala](http://rxscala.github.io)
- Effective testing
    - Unit testing and [Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) 
      with ScalaTest
    - [Mock objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) with [ScalaMock](http://scalamock.org/)
    - Functional testing (out-of-container) using [Robolectric](http://pivotal.github.com/robolectric/)
